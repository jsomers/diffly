I wanted a tool that made it really easy to give feedback in a visually intuitive way. It only needed to support (a) deletions, (b) insertions, and (c) comments. I wanted it to generate the visuals automatically as you made changes to the original text.

Here's how it works:

* Paste your original text into the copyediting area.

* When you're ready to start making changes, hit "mark start."

* There are three basic changes you can make: insertions, deletions, and comments.

* To make a comment, just highlight some text you want to comment on and hit the "[" key. It'll surround your selection in brackets. Put your comment in the parentheses that follow.

* Click the "finish" button to get a link to a page with the final marked-up version.
